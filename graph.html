            This is an implementation of the causal identifiability algorithm described in <a href="http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~jtian/r290-L.pdf">J.Tian, J.Pearl, <i>On the Identification of Causal Effects</i></a>
            It answers the question, is P(y|do(x)) identifiable in the graph you have drawn. If the query is identifiable then it is possible (in the infinite data limit) to calculate a point estimate for the causal effect on y of an intervention on x from purely observational data .
            <ul>
                <li>Add nodes by clicking on the canvas</li>
                <li>Select nodes by clicking on an existing node </li>
                <li>Add directed links by selecting the source node and then clicking on the destination node</li>
                <li>Add an undirected link (confounding variable) as above but hold down Cntl before clicking the destination node</li>
                <li>Label a node as the intervened on variable by selecting it and pushing the X key</li>
                <li>Label a node as the target variable by selecting it and pushing the Y key</li>
                <li>Remove nodes by selecting them and then hitting delete</li>
                <li>Remove an existing edge by adding it again</li>
                <li>Click the calculate button to determine if P(y|do(x)) is identifiable</li>
            </ul>
            The algorithm is only defined for acyclic graphs. Running it on a graph with cycles results in undefined behaviour.
